The purpose of this project is to automatically execute SQL scripts in the "data_check" folder to verify the numbers in the database before updating the tables. The checks include:

Identifying duplicate rows: Utilizing COUNT and COUNT(DISTINCT) on the primary key (id) to compare the results. If both return the same value, it indicates no duplication.

Monitoring low transactions: Examining the number of transactions each month. Months with transaction counts lower than 25% of the average are flagged as suspicious and require additional scrutiny before proceeding.

Detecting missing data: Generating a timeline bar graph where each bar represents a month. If a bar deviates significantly from the usual pattern, that month needs thorough verification before updating the database.

Once the current database is confirmed to be in good condition, SQL scripts in the "data_update" folder will be executed. This Python automation can significantly save time compared to manual checking and updating, which would take hours to run each schema individually.
